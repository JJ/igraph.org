---

The igraph community organises a workshop on the sustainability of network analysis software. There are various major network analysis packages, including not only igraph, but also several other popular packages, that are used by the network science research community to perform their analyses. Although the entire research community benefits from this software, it is not always clear how to ensure that the software remains available to the community in the future.

In this workshop, we bring together contributors of network analysis software with the broader research community. There are two key questions that we address during this workshop. First, how do the various network analysis packages ensure their sustainability? Secondly, what role could the broader network science community play in sustaining the tools essential to their studies?

We hope to stimulate mutual learning among the packages. We also aim to propose concrete ideas on how the broader research community could help ensure the sustainability of network analysis software.

**Date**: 21-22 June, 2023

**Location**: University Leiden, Leiden, the Netherlands

**Participation**: Invitation only
