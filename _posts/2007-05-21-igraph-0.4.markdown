igraph 0.4
=========

May 21, 2007

The major new additions in this release is a bunch of community
detection algorithms and support for the GML file format. Here 
is the complete list of changes:

<!--more-->

New in the C library
--------------------

- internal representation changed
- `igraph_neighbors` always returns an ordered list
- `igraph_is_loop` and `igraph_is_multiple` added

- topological sorting
- VF2 isomorphism algorithm
- support for reading the file format of the Graph Database for isomorphism
- `igraph_mincut` cat calculate the actual minimum cut
- girth calculation added, thanks to Keith Briggs
- support for reading and writing GML files

- Walktrap community detection algorithm added, thanks to Matthieu Latapy 
  and Pascal Pons
- edge betweenness based community detection algorithm added
- fast greedy algorithm for community detection by Clauset et al. added
  thanks to Aaron Clauset for sharing his code
- leading eigenvector community detection algorithm by Mark Newman added
- `igraph_community_to_membership` supporting function added, creates 
  a membership vector from a community structure merge tree
- modularity calculation added

New in the R interface
----------------------

- as the internal representation changed, graphs stored with 'save' 
  with an older igraph version cannot be read back with the new
  version reliably.
- `neighbors` returns ordered lists

- topological sorting
- VF2 isomorphism algorithm
- support for reading graphs from the Graph Database for isomorphism
- girth calculation added, thanks to Keith Briggs
- support for reading and writing GML files

- Walktrap community detection algorithm added, thanks to Matthieu Latapy 
  and Pascal Pons
- edge betweenness based community detection algorithm added
- fast greedy algorithm for community detection by Clauset et al. added
  thanks to Aaron Clauset for sharing his code  
- leading eigenvector community detection algorithm by Mark Newman added
- functions for creating denrdograms from the output of the 
  community detection algorithms added
- `community.to.membership` supporting function added, creates 
  a membership vector from a community structure merge tree
- modularity calculation added

- graphics parameter handling is completely rewritten, uniform handling 
  of colors and fonts, make sure you read `?igraph.plotting`
- new plotting parameter for edges: `arrow.mode`
- a bug corrected when playing a nonlinear `barabasi.game`
- better looking plotting in 3d using rglplot: edges are 3d too
- `rglplot` layout is allowed to be two dimensional now
- `rglplot` suspends updates while drawing, this makes it faster
- loop edges are correctly plotted by all three plotting functions

- better printing of attributes when printing graphs
- summary of a graph prints attribute names
- `is.igraph` rewritten to make it possible to inherit from the `igraph` class
- somewhat better looking progress meter for functions which support it

Others
------

- proper support for Debian packages (re)added
- many functions benefit from the new internal representation and are 
  faster now: transitivity, reciprocity, graph operator functions like 
  intersection and union, etc.
- igraph compiles with Microsoft Visual C++ now
- there were some internal changes to make igraph a real graph algorithm
  platform in the near future, but these are undocumented now

Bugs corrected
--------------

- corrected a bug when reading Pajek files: directed graphs were read as
  undirected
