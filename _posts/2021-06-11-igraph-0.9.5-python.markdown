[python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.9.5, the third bugfix release of
the 0.9 series, has arrived.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing
`pip install python-igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most
supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the
source code are also available from the [Python Package Index
page](https://pypi.org/project/python-igraph/0.9.5/).

See the changelogs on Github for relevant changes in 0.9.5:

This release also provides experimental native Python wheels for Apple Silicon CPUs. Note that the Apple Silicon wheels are _not tested_ in a CI environment yet; this will hopefully change in the near future when Github Actions starts supporting Apple Silicon. Until then, feel free to report any issues that you find with Apple Silicon wheels (or any other wheel) in the [issue tracker on Github](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/issues).
