igraph 0.10.0-rc.1, the first release candidate of igraph 0.10.0 is now available for download. We decided to go for a release candidate because there are lots of breaking changes in igraph 0.10.0 compared to previous versions, and we would like to gather some feedback from the community before going forward.

Since this version is a release candidate only, it is meant primarily for developers who are working on a project that depends on the igraph library and who want to be prepared in advance for the upcoming changes in igraph 0.10.0. There is no official tarball on the igraph.org homepage as the latest stable version is still 0.9.9 - you need to get the tarball from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.10.0-rc.1) instead. Here is a [direct link to the tarball](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/download/0.10.0-rc.1/igraph-0.10.0-rc.1.tar.gz) -- note that you will need to download the asset named `igraph-0.10.0-rc.1.tar.gz` as the link titled "Source code" is simply a snapshot of the Github repository.

For more details and a short description of breaking changes, please refer to the announcement in our [Discourse group](https://igraph.discourse.group/t/c-igraph-0-10-0-rc-1/1316).
