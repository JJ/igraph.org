igraph 0.5.3
============

November 22, 2009

New in the Python interface
---------------------------

- Added support for weighted diameter
- `get_eid()` considers edge directions by default from now on
- Fixed a memory leak in the attribute handler
- `NaN` and `inf` are treated correctly now

<!--more-->

Bugs corrected in the C layer
-----------------------------

- Betweenness and edge betweenness functions work for graphs with
  many shortest paths now (up to the limit of `long long int`)
- The configure script fails if there is no C compiler available
- Fixed a bug in `igraph_community_spinglass`, when csize was a `NULL`
  pointer, but membership was not
- Fixed a bug in `igraph_bipartite_projection` that caused occasional
  crashes on some systems
