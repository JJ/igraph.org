In an attempt to bring the R interface of igraph closer to the recent
developments of the C core, we have released [R-igraph](https://igraph.org/r/)
1.2.7, the seventh bugfix release of the 1.2 series. This version updates
the C core of igraph within the R interface to version 0.8.5, which, while
still several versions behind the mainline C core, fixes a range of bugs
compared to the previous release and introduces a few new functions.

This release is only the beginning; in the next few months we aim to process
most of the issues on the [Github issue
tracker](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/issues), close the ones that are not
relevant any more, fix the ones that should be fixed, and then proceed with
updating the R interface to version 0.9.4 of the C core, which is the most
recent C core version at the time of writing.

Release Notes
-------------

Added:

- `cluster_leiden()` added as an interface to the Leiden community detection
  algorithm in the C core of igraph
  ([#399](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/issues/399).
- `cluster_fluid_communities()` added as an interface to the fluid communities
  algorithm of the C core of igraph
  ([#454](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/issues/454).

Fixed:

- `make_lattice()` correctly rounds `length` to the nearest integer while
  printing a warning ([#115](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/issues/115).
- `make_empty_graph(NULL)` now prints an error instead of producing an
  invalid graph ([#404](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/issues/404)).
- `make_graph(c())` now produces an empty graph instead of printing a
  misleading error message ([#431](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/431)).
- Printing a graph where some edges have NA as the names of both endpoints
  does not produce a misleading error message any more
  ([#410](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/410)).
- The `types` argument of functions related to bipartite graphs now prints
  a warning when the types are coerced to booleans
  ([#476](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/476)).
- Betweenness normalisation no longer overflows
  ([#442](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/442)).
- `layout_with_sugiyama()` returns a layout of type matrix even if there is
  only one vertex in the graph ([#408](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/408)).
- Plotting a null graph (i.e. a graph with no vertices) does not throw an error
  any more ([#387](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph/387)).

Deprecated:
- The `membership` argument of `modularity.matrix()` is now deprecated as the
  function never needed it anyway.
- `modularity()` now prints a warning when it is applied on a directed graph
  because the implementation in igraph's C core does not support directed
  graphs as of version 0.8.5. The warning will be turned into an error in
  the next minor (1.3.0) version of the R interface; the error will be removed
  later when the C core is updated to a version that supports modularity for
  directed networks.
- `transitivity()` now prints a warning when its local variant (`type="local"`)
  is called on a directed graph or a graph with multiple edges beecause the
  implementation in the C core of igraph does not work reliably in these cases
  as of version 0.8.5. The warning will be turned into an error in the next
  minor (1.3.0) version of the R interface; the error will be removed later
  when the C core is updated to a version that supports transitivity for
  networks with multiple edges.

Misc:
- Documentation improvements.
