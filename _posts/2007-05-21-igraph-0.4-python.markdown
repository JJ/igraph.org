igraph 0.4
=========

May 21, 2007

The major new additions in this release is a bunch of community
detection algorithms and support for the GML file format. Here 
is the complete list of changes:

<!--more-->

New in the C library
--------------------

- internal representation changed
- `igraph_neighbors` always returns an ordered list
- `igraph_is_loop` and `igraph_is_multiple` added

- topological sorting
- VF2 isomorphism algorithm
- support for reading the file format of the Graph Database for isomorphism
- `igraph_mincut` cat calculate the actual minimum cut
- girth calculation added, thanks to Keith Briggs
- support for reading and writing GML files

- Walktrap community detection algorithm added, thanks to Matthieu Latapy 
  and Pascal Pons
- edge betweenness based community detection algorithm added
- fast greedy algorithm for community detection by Clauset et al. added
  thanks to Aaron Clauset for sharing his code
- leading eigenvector community detection algorithm by Mark Newman added
- `igraph_community_to_membership` supporting function added, creates 
  a membership vector from a community structure merge tree
- modularity calculation added

Others
------

- proper support for Debian packages (re)added
- many functions benefit from the new internal representation and are 
  faster now: transitivity, reciprocity, graph operator functions like 
  intersection and union, etc.
- igraph compiles with Microsoft Visual C++ now
- there were some internal changes to make igraph a real graph algorithm
  platform in the near future, but these are undocumented now

Bugs corrected
--------------

- corrected a bug when reading Pajek files: directed graphs were read as
  undirected
