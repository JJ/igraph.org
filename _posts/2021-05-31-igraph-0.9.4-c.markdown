[C/igraph](https://igraph.org/c/) 0.9.4, the fourth bugfix release of the 0.9 series, has arrived.

The source can be obtained from [the GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.9.4).

This release includes bug fixes only.

### Changed

 - Unweighted transitivity (i.e. clustering coefficient) calculations now ignore multi-edges and edge directions instead of rejecting multigraphs and directed graphs.
 - `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` now returns an error code if the input graph has multiple edges (which is not handled correctly by the implementation yet).

### Fixed

 - `igraph_local_scan_k_ecount()` now handles loops correctly.
 - `igraph_transitivity_avglocal_undirected()` is no longer slower than `igraph_transitivity_local_undirected()`.
 - Worked around an invalid warning issued by Clang 9.0 when compiling with OpenMP.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.
