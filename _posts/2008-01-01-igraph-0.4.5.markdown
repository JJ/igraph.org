=========

January 1, 2008

New:

- Cohesive block finding in the R interface, thanks to Peter McMahan
  for contributing his code. See James Moody and Douglas R. White,

  Conception of Social Groups American Sociological Review 68(1):1-25 
- Biconnected components and articulation points.
- R interface: better printing of attributes.
- R interface: graph attributes can be used via `$`.

New in the C library:

- `igraph_vector_bool_t` data type.

Bug fixed:

- Erdos-Renyi random graph generators rewritten.
