igraph 0.7.1
============

April 21, 2014

Release Notes
-------------

Some bug fixes, to make sure that the code included in
'Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R' works. See
https://github.com/kolaczyk/sand

Detailed changes:

- Graph drawing: fix labels of curved edges, issue #181.
- Graph drawing: allow fixing edge labels at given positions,
  issue #181.
- Drop the 'type' vertex attribute after bipartite projection,
  the projections are not bipartite any more, issue #255.
- Print logical attributes in header properly (i.e. encoded by `l`,
  not `x`,  which is for complex attributes. Issue #578.
- Add a constructor for `communities` objects, see `create.communities()`.
  Issue #547.
- Better error handling in the GraphML parser.
- GraphML reader is a bit more lenient now; makes it possible to read
  GraphML files saved from yWorks apps.
- Fixed a bug in `constaint()`, issue #580.
- Bipartite projection now detects invalid edges instead of giving
  a cryptic error, issue #543.
- Fixed the `simplify` argument of `graph.formula()`, which was
  broken, issue #586.
- The function `crossing()` adds better names to the result,
  fixes issue #587.
- The `sir()` function gives an error if the input graph is
  not simple, fixes issue #582.
- Calling igraph functions from igraph callbacks is not allowed now,
  fixes issue #571.
