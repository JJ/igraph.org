igraph 0.5
=========

February 14, 2008

Release notes
-------------

There are a lot of improvements and corrections in this version. 
We would like to thank all the people who sent comments, bug reports,
patches, or just questions. Without their contribution igraph would be 
definitely much less and worse than it is now. Please keep sending your 
comments and ideas!

Here is a list of major changes, with links to the relevant sections of the 
documentation. See below for the complete list of changes.

## igraph as a platform

We took some step towards turning igraph to an efficient platform for 
implementing graph algorithms. In particular, we have a set of 
<a href="doc-0.5/html/ch06.html">utility types</a> that support general
scientific computing and working with graphs: vectors, matrices,
stacks, queues, heaps, adjacency lists, etc.

## Graph isomorphism

igraph includes the BLISS graph isomorphism algorithm and
implementation now. This and the improved VF2 implementation, which
can now calculate subgraph isomorphism, make igraph support the
bleeding edge of graph isomorphism algorithms. Many thanks to the
authors of BLISS. See the details in the 
<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph-Isomorphism.html">Reference Manual</a>.

## ARPACK for eigenvalue problems

ARPACK is a library for solving large scale sparse eigenvalue
problems. In igraph it is very handy, as many centrality problems are
in fact eigenvalue problems: Kleinberg's hub and authority scores, 
PageRank, the leading eigenvector community detection algorithm are
some examples. Many thanks to the authors of ARPACK and James Fowler,
who suggested to include it in igraph. 

See the details in the
<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph-Arpack.html">Reference Manual</a>.

## Other bits

### Create famous graphs easily

Some classic graphs can be created by giving their name. This is
very handy if one needs a test graph quickly. See 
<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_famous.html">`igraph_famous`</a>.
(The idea is based on Combinatorica, a Mathematica extension.)

### Improvements for weighted graphs

Many functions were updated to handle weighted graphs:
<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_community_fastgreedy.html">
fast greedy community detection</a>,
<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_pagerank.html">Page Rank</a>,
<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_modularity.html">modularity calculation</a>, 
<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_layout_fruchterman_reingold.html">
the Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm</a>.

### Non-simple graphs

Some functions were added and improved to handle non-simple graphs
(i.e. graphs with loop and/or multiple edges) better: testing that a
graph is simple (<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_is_simple.html">
`igraph_is_simple`</a>),
testing for multiple edges (<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_is_multiple.html">
`igraph_is_multiple`</a>), and counting the multiplicity of 
edges (<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_count_multiple.html">
`igraph_count_multiple`</a>).

### The graphopt layout algorithm

This is a nice force-based layout algorithm. See the documentation of
details (<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_layout_graphopt.html">
`igraph_layout_graphopt`</a>).

### Support for the DOT file format

igraph can now write graphs to files in the DOT format, used by
GraphViz. See documentation:
<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_write_graph_dot.html">
`igraph_write_graph_dot`</a>.

### Dyad and triad census

Classic social network analysis tools for classifying the dyads
(<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_dyad_census.html">
`igraph_dyad_census`</a>), and triads
(<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_triad_census.html">
`igraph_triad_census`</a>) of a network.

### Biconnected components and articulation points

igraph is now able to calculate biconnected components
(<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_biconnected_components.html">
`igraph_biconnected_components`</a>), and articulation points
(<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_articulation_points.html">
`igraph_articulation_points`</a>).

### Estimating closeness and betweenness

These measures can be quickly estimated by specifying an upper bound
for path lengths to be considered. This is useful for larger graphs,
for which the calculation takes a long time. See documentation for
closeness (<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_closeness_estimate.html">
`igraph_closeness_estimate`</a>),
betweenness (<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_betweenness_estimate.html">
`igraph_betweenness_estimate`</a>), and edge betweenness
(<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_edge_betweenness_estimate.html">
`igraph_edge_betweenness_estimate`</a>).

### Functions for vertex similarity measures

Two vertex similarity measures based on the number of common neighbors
are introduced, the Jaccard
(<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_similarity_jaccard.html">
`igraph_similarity_jaccard`</a>), and the Dice
(<a href="doc-0.5/html/igraph_similarity_dice.html">
`igraph_similarity_dice`</a>).

### Handle attributes from C

An experimental C attribute interface was added. This allows using
graph/vertex/edge attributes when programming from C. <a
href="doc-0.5/html/ch09s02.html">See
more here.</a>

New in the C library
--------------------

- Many types (stack, matrix, dqueue, etc.) are templates now
  They were also rewritten to provide a better organized interface
- VF2 graph isomorphism routines can check subgraph isomorphism now,
  and they are able to return matching(s)
- The BLISS graph isomorphism algorithm is included in igraph now. See
  `igraph_canonical_permutation`, `igraph_isomorphic_bliss`
- We use ARPACK for eigenvalue/eigenvector calculation. This means that the
  following functions were rewritten: `igraph_pagerank`,
  `igraph_community_leading_eigenvector_*`. New functions based on
  ARPACK: `igraph_eigenvector_centrality`, `igraph_hub_score`,
  `igraph_authority_score`, `igraph_arpack_rssolve`, `igraph_arpack_rnsolve`
- Experimental C attribute interface added. I.e. it is possible to use
  graph/vertex/edge attributes from C code now.

- Edge weights for Fruchterman-Reingold layout.
- Line graph calculation.
- Kautz and de Bruijn graph generators
- Support for writing graphs in DOT format
- Jaccard and Dice similarity coefficients added
- `igraph_count_multiple` added

  `igraph_adjedgelist_t`)

- igraph_to_undirected handles attributes now
- Geometric random graph generator can return the coordinates of the vertices
- Function added to convert leading eigenvector community structure result to
  a membership vector (`igraph_le_community_to_membership`)
- Weighted fast greedy community detection
- Weighted page rank calculation
- Functions for estimating closeness, betweenness, edge betweenness by 
  introducing a cutoff for path lengths
- Weighted modularity calculation
- `igraph_permute_vertices` added
- Betweenness ans closeness calculations are speeded up
- Startup positions can be supplied to the Kamada-Kawai layout
  algorithms
- `igraph_read_graph_*` functions can handle all possible line
  terminators now (\r, \n, \r\n, \n\r)
- Error handling was rewritten for walktrap community detection,
  the calculation can be interrupted now
- The maxflow/mincut functions allow to supply a null pointer for edge
  capacities, implying unit capacities for all edges
