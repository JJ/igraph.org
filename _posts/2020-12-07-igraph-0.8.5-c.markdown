[C/igraph](https://igraph.org/c/) 0.8.5, the fifth bugfix release of the 0.8 series, has arrived.

The sources can be obtained from [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.8.5).

This release includes bug fixes only. The changelog is below.

### Changed

 - `igraph_write_graph_pajek()`: the function now always uses the platform-native line endings (CRLF on Windows, LF on Unix and macOS). Earlier versions tried to enforce Windows line endings, but this was error-prone, and since all recent versions of Pajek support both line endings, enforcing Windows line endings is not necessary any more.

### Fixed

 - Fixed several compilation issues with MINGW32/64, thanks to [@jannick0](https://github.com/jannick0/)
 - `igraph_layout_davidson_harel()` was not interruptible; now it is.
 - Added a missing memory cleanup call in `igraph_i_cattribute_combine_vertices()`.
 - Fixed a few memory leaks in test cases.
