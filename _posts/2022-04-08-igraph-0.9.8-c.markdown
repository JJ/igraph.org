### Fixed

 - Assertion failure in `igraph_bfs()` when an empty `roots` or `restricted` vector was provided.
 - `igraph_diversity()` now returns 0 for degree-1 vertices. Previously it incorrectly returned NaN or +-Inf depending on roundoff errors.
 - `igraph_community_walktrap()` does not crash any more when provided with
   `modularity=NULL` and `membership=NULL`.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.
