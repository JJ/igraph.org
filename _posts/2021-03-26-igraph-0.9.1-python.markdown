[python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.9.1, the first bugfix release of
the 0.9 series, has arrived.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing
`pip install python-igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most
supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the
source code are also available from the [Python Package Index
page](https://pypi.org/project/python-igraph/0.9.1/).

This release brings `python-igraph` up-to-date with igraph 0.9.1. See the
changelogs on Github for relevant changes in 0.9.0 and 0.9.1:
