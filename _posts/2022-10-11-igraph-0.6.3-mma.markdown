A new maintenance release of [IGraph/M](http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM) is now available. This is a bugfix release recommended for all users. As usual, the simplest way to upgrade is to evaluate the following, and then restart Mathematica:

```
Get["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szhorvat/IGraphM/master/IGInstaller.m"]
```

#### IGraph/M 0.6.3

Changed:

 - When an invalid vertex is passed to IGraph/M functions, now the message shown is `IGraphM::invv` instead of `VertexIndex::inv`.

Fixed:

 - In rare cases, vertex names that were lists of other vertex names in the same graph were misinterpreted. This affected only Mathematica 12.0 and later.
 - `IGCommunitiesLeadingEigenvector` is less likely to fail to converge now.
 - `IGCommunitiesLeadingEigenvector` now respects random seeds set in Mathematica. These affect only the random starting vector it uses internally, which can very rarely cause non-deterministic output.
 - `IGBarabasiAlbertGame` no longer accepts negative or zero exponents, as these were not handled correctly.
 - `IGBridges` is no longer prone to stack overflow when given very large graphs.

Other:

 - Performance improvements for `IGGraphEditor`.
 - Documentation improvements.
