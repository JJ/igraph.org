igraph 0.5.3
============

November 22, 2009

Bugs corrected in the R interface
---------------------------------

- Some small changes to make `R CMD check` clean
- Fixed a bug in `graph.incidence`, the `directed` and `mode` arguments 
  were not handled correctly
- Betweenness and edge betweenness functions work for graphs with
  many shortest paths now (up to the limit of long long int)
- When compiling the package, the configure script fails if there is
  no C compiler available
- `igraph.from.graphNEL` creates the right number of loop edges now
- Fixed a bug in `bipartite.projection()` that caused occasional crashes 
  on some systems
