Just in time before the Christmas holidays, [IGraph/M](http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM) 0.6.5 is now released. This version (along with the unreleased 0.6.4) brings greatly improved performance when computing proximity graphs, new convenience functions, as well as robustness improvements. As usual, you can conveniently upgrade by running the installer script, using the following command:

```
Get["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szhorvat/IGraphM/master/IGInstaller.m"]
```

#### 0.6.5

Other:

 - Improved error checking and added more internal consistency checks to help debug issues with recent Mathematica versions.

#### 0.6.4

Added:

 - `IGBetaWeightedGabrielGraph` for computing the β value where each edge of a lune-based β-skeleton would disappear (experimental function).
 - `IGModularityMatrix` gives the modularity matrix of a network.
 - `IGCanonicalLabeledGraph` creates a canonical representation of a labeled graph without changing vertex names. Graphs which are considered equivalent by `IGSameGraphQ` have the same canonical representation. It is intended for removing duplicate graphs using `DeleteDuplicatesBy`.
 - `IGCanonicalEdgeList` creates a canonical representation of an edge list, in a manner similar to `IGCanonicalLabeledGraph`.

Other:

 - Documentation improvements
 - Significant performance improvements for the calculation of lune and circle based β skeletons when using large β values.
