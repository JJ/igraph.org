igraph 0.3.3
===========

New in the C library
--------------------

* `igraph_connect_neighborhood()`, nomen est omen
* `igraph_watts_strogatz_game()` and `igraph_rewire_edges()`
* K-core decomposition: `igraph_coreness()`
* Clique and independent vertex set related functions:
  `igraph_cliques()`, `igraph_independent_vertex_sets()`,
  `igraph_maximal_cliques()`, `igraph_maximal_independent_vertex_sets()`,
  `igraph_independence_number()`, `igraph_clique_number(),
  Some of these function were ported from the very_nauty library
  of Keith Briggs, thanks Keith!
* The GraphML file format now supports graph attributes
* Transitivity calculation speeded up
* Correct transitivity calculation for multigraphs (ie. non-simple graphs)

Bugs corrected

* `make install` installs the library correctly on Cygwin now
* Pajek parser corrected to read files with MacOS newline characters correctly
