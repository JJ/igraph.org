[python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.10.1, the first bugfix release of the 0.10 series, has arrived. (And we forgot to announce 0.10.0 separately, sorry). These releases update the C core of igraph to 0.10.0 and bring several improvements to the plotting functionality of the library, including an improved Matplotlib plotting backend and an experimental Plotly backend.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing `pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the source code are also available from the [Python Package Index page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.10.1/).

See the changelog on Github for relevant changes in 0.10.0 and 0.10.1:
