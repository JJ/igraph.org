igraph 0.4.4
=========

October 3, 2007

This release should work seemlessly with the new R 2.6.0 version.
Some other bugs were also fixed:

- A bug was fixed in the Erdos-Renyi graph generator, which sometimes
  added an extra vertex.
- MSVC compilation issues were fixed.
- MinGW compilation fixes.
