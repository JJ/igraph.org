Release 0.9.0 of igraph's C core has arrived, almost exactly one year after the
latest minor release, 0.8.0. This release brings several new features and
improvements, and also a complete switch from the old `autotools`-based build
system to a new one based on [CMake](https://cmake.org). This results in faster
build times and the opportunity to use alternative build tools instead of
`make`; in particular, igraph now support [`ninja`](https://ninja-build.org) and
can also make use of a locally installed [`ccache`](https://ccache.dev)
compiler cache for even faster builds.

We gratefully acknowledge support from [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com) for
the development of igraph. In addition, we would like to thank everyone who
reported issues, contributed features or fixes, or edited the documentation.
igraph is an open-source project run by volunteers. *As always, your
contributions are very welcome!*

Most people use igraph through its high-level interfaces for [R](https://igraph.org/r/),
[Python](https://igraph.org/python/) or [Mathematica](http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM).
A new release of the Python interface, based on 0.9.0, is expected to be
released in a few days. The R and Mathematica interfaces already include some
of the improvements, and will continue to integrate more.

The sources and the changelog can be obtained from [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.9.0).
