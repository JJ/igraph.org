[python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.9.11, the ninth bugfix release
of the 0.9 series, has arrived.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing
`pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most
supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the
source code are also available from the [Python Package Index
page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.9.11/).

This is the first release that provides pre-compiled `musllinux` wheels for
environments running Alpine Linux.

See the changelog on Github for relevant changes in 0.9.11:
