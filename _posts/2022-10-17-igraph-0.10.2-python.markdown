[python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.10.2, the second bugfix release of the 0.10 series, has arrived. Thise release updates the C core of igraph to 0.10.2, adds support for Python 3.11 and fixes a crash and a reference leak in earlier versions of the library. There are also some minor additions and improvements; please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph/releases/tag/0.10.2) for more details.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing `pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the source code are also available from the [Python Package Index page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.10.1/).

The documentation of the project has also been moved to [Read The Docs](https://igraph.readthedocs.io).
