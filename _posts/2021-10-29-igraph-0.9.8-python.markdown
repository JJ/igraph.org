[python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.9.8, the sixth bugfix release of
the 0.9 series, has arrived.

The only significant change in this release is that the Python interface of igraph has been renamed
from `python-igraph` to `igraph` on PyPI. We are very grateful to
[Patrick Fuller](https://github.com/patrickfuller), the previous owner of the
`igraph` package on PyPI for giving up the ownership of `igraph` and letting us
use the name instead.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is still via `pip`; typing
`pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most
supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the
source code are also available from the [Python Package Index
page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.9.8/).

`python-igraph` will keep on working on PyPI until September 1, 2022, but it is
now only a stub package that depends on `igraph`. Running `pip install
python-igraph` will in turn install the matching version of the
[`igraph`](https://pypi.org/project/igraph) package from PyPI.

* **Projects listing `python-igraph` in their dependencies should migrate to
  using `igraph` as soon as possible** to keep on receiving updates after
  September 1, 2022.

* Maintainers that provide pre-packaged versions of `python-igraph` in Linux
  distributions should switch to following the
  [`igraph`](https://pypi.org/project/igraph) package on PyPI instead of
  `python-igraph`.
