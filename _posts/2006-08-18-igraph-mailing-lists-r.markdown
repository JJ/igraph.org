igraph mailing lists
====================

August 18, 2006

I've set up two igraph mailing lists: **igraph-help** for
general igraph questions and discussion and
**igraph-anonunce** for announcements. See 
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-help and
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-announce
for subscription information, archives, etc.
