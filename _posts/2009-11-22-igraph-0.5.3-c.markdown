igraph 0.5.3
============

November 22, 2009

Bugs corrected
--------------

- Betweenness and edge betweenness functions work for graphs with
  many shortest paths now (up to the limit of `long long int`)
- The configure script fails if there is no C compiler available
- Fixed a bug in `igraph_community_spinglass`, when csize was a `NULL`
  pointer, but membership was not
- Fixed a bug in `igraph_bipartite_projection` that caused occasional
  crashes on some systems
