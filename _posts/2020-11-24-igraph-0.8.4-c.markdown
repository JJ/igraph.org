[C/igraph](https://igraph.org/c/) 0.8.4, the third bugfix release of the 0.8 series, has arrived.

The sources can be obtained from [the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.8.4).

This release includes bug fixes and documentation improvements. The changelog is below.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_i_cattribute_combine_vertices()`: fixed invalid cleanup code that eventually filled up the "finally" stack when combining vertices with attributes extensively.
 - `igraph_hrg_sample()`: fixed incorrect function prototype
 - `igraph_is_posinf()` and `igraph_is_neginf()`: fixed incorrect result on platforms where the sign of the result of `isinf()` is not indicative of the sign of the input.
 - Fixed building with vendored LAPACK and external BLAS
 - Fixed building with XCode 12.2 on macOS

### Other

 - Documentation improvements
 - General code cleanup to reduce the number of compiler warnings
