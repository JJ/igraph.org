igraph 0.4.2
=========

June 7, 2007

This is another bugfix release, as there was a serious bug in the 
R package of the previous version: it could not read and write graphs
to files in any format under MS Windows.

Some other bits added:

- circular Reingold-Tilford layout generator for trees
- corrected a bug, Pajek files are written properly under MS Windows now.
- `arrow.size` graphical edge parameter added in the R interface.
