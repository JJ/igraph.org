[C/igraph](https://igraph.org/c/) 0.9.2, the second bugfix release of the 0.9
series, has arrived.

The source can be obtained from [the GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.9.2).

This release includes bug fixes only. We have also added support for CMake
package files, making it easier to use igraph in CMake-based projects.

### Added

 - CMake package files are now installed with igraph. This allows `find_package(igraph)` to find igraph and detect the appropriate compilation options for projects that link to it.

### Fixed

 - igraph can now be used as a CMake subproject in other CMake-based projects.
 - The documentaton can now be built from the release tarball.
 - Configuration will no longer fail when the release tarball is extracted into a subdirectory of an unrelated git repository.
 - The generated pkg-config file was incorrect when `CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>` variables were absolute paths.
 - On Unix-like systems, the library name is now `libigraph.so.0.0.0`, as it used to be for igraph 0.8 and earlier.
 - Fixed a return type mismatch in parser sources, and fixed some warnings with recent versions of gcc.
 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_get_shortest_paths_dijkstra()` and `igraph_get_shortest_paths_bellman_ford()` that returned incorrect results for unreachable vertices.

### Other

 - Improved installation instructions and tutorial.
