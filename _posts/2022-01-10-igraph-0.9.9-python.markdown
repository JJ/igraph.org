[python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) 0.9.9, the seventh bugfix release
of the 0.9 series, has arrived.

The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via `pip`; typing
`pip install igraph` should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most
supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the
source code are also available from the [Python Package Index
page](https://pypi.org/project/igraph/0.9.9/).

ARM64 (Apple Silicon) wheels are now officially supported from this release.

See the changelog on Github for relevant changes in 0.9.9:
