<p>The sources can be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraph/releases/tag/0.8.5">the GitHub releases page</a>.</p>

<p>This release includes bug fixes only. The changelog is below.</p>

<h3>Changed</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>igraph_write_graph_pajek()</code>: the function now always uses the platform-native line endings (CRLF on Windows, LF on Unix and macOS). Earlier versions tried to enforce Windows line endings, but this was error-prone, and since all recent versions of Pajek support both line endings, enforcing Windows line endings is not necessary any more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed several compilation issues with MINGW32/64, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jannick0/">@jannick0</a></li>
<li><code>igraph_layout_davidson_harel()</code> was not interruptible; now it is.</li>
<li>Added a missing memory cleanup call in <code>igraph_i_cattribute_combine_vertices()</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed a few memory leaks in test cases.</li>

  <p><a href="https://igraph.org/python/">python-igraph</a> 0.8.3, the third bugfix release of
the 0.8 series, has arrived.</p>

<p>The preferred way of installing the Python interface is via <code>pip</code>; typing
<code>pip install python-igraph</code> should install a pre-compiled Python wheel on most
supported platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS). The pre-compiled wheels and the
source code are also available from the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-igraph/0.8.3/">Python Package Index
page</a>.</p>

<p>This release brings <code>python-igraph</code> up-to-date with igraph 0.8.3, and it also
contains bug fixes and performance improvements. This release will also be the
last one whose version number is deliberately in sync with the version number
of the C core. The changelog is below.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><code>Graph.community_leiden()</code> now supports a negative number of iterations; it will keep on iterating until the algorithm reaches a stable partition.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Graph.Incidence()</code> now supports weighted graphs, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/PuneethaPai/">@PuneethaPai</a></p></li>
<li><p>You can now create a <code>Graph</code> object from a <code>pandas</code> dataframe with <code>Graph.DataFrame</code>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/iosonofabio/">@iosonofabio</a></p></li>
<li><p>Added conversion to/from <code>networkx</code> and <code>graph-tool</code> with <code>Graph.{to,from}_{networkx,graph_tool}</code>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/iosonofabio/">@iosonofabio</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>Graph.add_edges()</code> and <code>Graph.add_vertices()</code> now supports specifying attributes for the newly added vertices and edges, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/iosonofabio/">@iosonofabio</a></p></li>
<li><p>Added <code>Graph.dfs()</code> and <code>Graph.dfsiter()</code>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/iosonofabio/">@iosonofabio</a></p></li>
<li><p>Added <code>Graph.bridges()</code> to get the bridges of a graph.</p></li>
<li><p>Added <code>Graph.clear()</code> to remove all edges, vertices and graph attributes in a single call, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/iosonofabio/">@iosonofabio</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Changed</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Upgraded igraph C library to 0.8.3.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph union and intersection now supports graphs with vertex names, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/iosonofabio/">@iosonofabio</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>Graph.delete_vertices(None)</code> and <code>Graph.delete_edges(None)</code> are now deprecated; use <code>Graph.delete_vertices()</code> and <code>Graph.delete_edges()</code> (without a positional argument) instead to delete all vertices or edges. The old syntax will be removed in 0.9.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><code>setup.py</code> now works on Windows with MinGW, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Parakoopa/">@Parakoopa</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>Graph.difference()</code> now treats loop edges correctly</p></li>
<li><p><code>summary()</code> does not fail with non-string vertex names any more, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/deeenes/">@deeenes</a></p></li>
<li><p>The Reingold-Tilford layout should not produce edge crossings on tree graphs any more.</p></li>
<li><p>The postprocessing step of <code>Graph.biconnected_components()</code> is much faster now (#281); the earlier version was responsible for a significant speed difference between the C core and the Python interface.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Other</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Various documentation improvements, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/chrisfalter/">@chrisfalter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iosonofabio/">@iosonofabio</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kmankinen/">@kmankinen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/remysucre/">@remysucre</a>, <a href="https://github.com/szhorvat/">@szhorvat</a></p></li>

<li><p>Dropped support for Python 3.5, added support for Python 3.9.</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Changed</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>igraph_eigenvector_centrality()</code> assumes the adjacency matrix of undirected graphs to have twice the number of self-loops for each vertex on the diagonal. This makes the results consistent between an undirected graph and its directed equivalent when each edge is replaced by a mutual edge pair.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>igraph_isomorphic()</code> now verifies that the input graphs have no multi-edges.</li>
<li><code>igraph_difference()</code> was creating superfluous self loops.</li>
<li><code>igraph_count_multiple()</code> was giving incorrect results for self-loops in directed graph.</li>
<li><code>igraph_betweenness_estimate()</code>: fixed incorrect results with finite cutoff.</li>
<li><code>igraph_eigen_matrix_symmetric()</code>: fixed incorrect matrix multiplication.</li>
<li>Corrected several issues that could arise during an error condition.</li>
<li><code>igraph_realize_degree_sequence()</code> did not correctly detect some non-graphical inputs.</li>

<li><code>igraph_eigenvector_centrality()</code>: corrected the handling of self-loops.</li>
<li><code>igraph_layout_reingold_tilford()</code>: fixed an issue where branches of the tree would sometimes overlap. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other</h3>

<ul>

    <h1><span id="/2020/05/27/funding" class="anchor">&nbsp;</span>
    <a href="/2020/05/27/funding.html">Funding from CZI</a></h1>
  </div>
    
  <p>We are excited to announce that the igraph project will be <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/">supported</a> with a grant of $180,000 from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/">Essential Open Source Software for Science</a> program. It was recognized that igraph fulfills a critical role for providing network analysis in a variety of scientific domains, including biomedical research. The funding will expedite ongoing development efforts, and should result in a 1.0 release of igraph’s C core with a stable, well-documented and supported API.</p>

<p>For years, the development of igraph was done on a voluntary basis. With funding available, we can make sure developers have more time available to dedicate to igraph. In particular, the funding will support <a href="https://github.com/gaborcsardi">Gábor Csárdi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ntamas">Tamás Nepusz</a>, <a href="http://szhorvat.net/">Szabolcs Horvát</a>, <a href="https://www.traag.net/">Vincent Traag</a> and <a href="http://fabilab.org/">Fabio Zanini</a>.</p>

<p>The core of igraph is written in C, but most people use igraph through its high-level interfaces for R, Python or Mathematica. Much of the development effort will be concentrated on the core of igraph, but the high-level interfaces will not be overlooked. </p>

<p>Even though we will dedicate more time to igraph, the project cannot survive without a vibrant community of users and contributors. Whether you reported issues, contributed code or improved the documentation, your contributions remain vital to the project. We hope that our new <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group/">community forum</a> will enable us to form a tighter and more supportive community, where you can ask questions, support others, or discuss recent advances in network analysis or graph theory.</p>

<p>The project will start from the 1st of September onwards, and will last for a year. The 1.0 version is planned to be released towards the end of the project.</p>

    <a href="/2020/02/14/igraph-0.8.0-python.html">python-igraph 0.8.0</a></h1>
  </div>
    
  <p>Release 0.8.0 of igraph&#39;s Python interface follows the recent release of
version 0.8.0 of the C core with many bug fixes that have accumulated over the
last five years, and an improved build process that does not require the C core
of igraph to be downloaded at the time when <code>python-igraph</code> is installed; the
tarball of <code>python-igraph</code> already bundles the appropriate version of the
C core in it.</p>

<p>Including the C core directly in the source tarball also allows us to decouple
python-igraph&#39;s version number from the version number of the C core in the
future. This means that we no longer have to wait for a release of the C core
in order to fix some bugs in the Python interface.</p>

<h2>Precompiled Python wheels</h2>

<p>Starting from this release, we will also aim to provide pre-compiled Python
wheels for most platforms. The current release includes Python wheels for
Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 on Windows, macOS and Linux, so most users will
not have to compile anything when installing <code>python-igraph</code> from pip.
Currently the only limitation is that the Windows wheels do not support GraphML
import; this will be fixed in the next patch release (0.8.1).</p>

<h2>End of support for Python 2.7</h2>

<p><code>python-igraph</code> 0.8.x will also be the <em>last</em> version that supports Python 2.7.
Since Python 2 has <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">reached its end of life</a>,
we will drop support for Python 2 before <code>python-igraph</code> 0.9 so we can simplify
some parts of the codebase where we needed to introduce additional code to
support both Python versions.</p>

<p>As for Python 3, we are committing ourselves to supporting <em>at least</em> the last
three minor releases of Python 3.</p>

<p>Although we are not suporting PyPy officially, <code>python-igraph</code> will also be
tested with PyPy regularly in a CI environment, and we will strive to fix any
issues that arise with PyPy. If you use <code>python-igraph</code> with PyPy and you are
willing to become an official maintainer responsible for PyPy compatibility,
please let us know in the <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group/">community forum</a>.</p>

<h2>New community forum</h2>

<p>Concurrently with the release of igraph 0.8, we have launched <a href="https://igraph.discourse.group/">a new community
forum</a>, which replaces the mailing list as
the main support channel. The community forum is also meant for users of
<code>python-igraph</code>, so If you are a current <code>python-igraph</code> user or just
interested in the project, please join!</p>

<p>We would like to thank everyone who reported issues, contributed features or
fixes, or edited the documentation. igraph is an open-source project run by
volunteers. <em>As always, your contributions are very welcome!</em></p>

  <p>Release 0.8.0 of igraph&#39;s C core, coming almost five years after 0.7.1, is a major improvement with several new features, performance and robustness improvements, and many bug fixes. New functionality includes additional graph generators, functions for handling trees, new community detection methods, improved clique finding, spectral graph embedding, as well as several other features. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraph/blob/0.8.0/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for more details.</p>

<p>We would like to thank everyone who reported issues, contributed features or fixes, or edited the documentation. igraph is an open-source project run by volunteers. <em>As always, your contributions are very welcome!</em></p>

<p>Most people use igraph through its high-level interfaces for <a href="https://igraph.org/r/">R</a>, <a href="https://igraph.org/python/">Python</a> or <a href="http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/IGraphM">Mathematica</a>. A new release of the Python interface, incorporating all these improvements, is expected to be released in a few weeks. The R and Mathematica interfaces already include some of the improvements, and will continue to integrate more.</p>

  <h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>This is a new major release, with a lot of UI changes. We tried to
make it easier to use, with short and easy to remember, consistent
function names. Unfortunately this also means that many functions
have new names now, but don&#39;t worry, all the old names still work.</p>

<p>Apart from the new names, the biggest change in this release is
that most functions that used to return numeric vertex or edge ids,
return vertex/edge sequences now. This requires some time to get used
to and if you want the numeric ids instead, just use the <code>as.vector()</code>
function on the vertex/edge sequences.</p>

<p>We will update the documentation on this site, once the package
is on CRAN and available for all architectures.</p><p><a href="/2015/06/24/igraph-1.0.0-r.html">More &#8594;</a></p>

  </div>
    
  <p>A couple of days ago we changed how we use GitHub for igraph
development. Our goal is to make igraph development more accessible, and
our build process simpler. Instead of using a common repository for
everything, we now use separate repos for the igraph C library, the R
package and the Python extension. The igraph.org website was already in a
separate repository, and we will also break up the R package, by putting
loosely coupled parts in their own packages and repositories.</p>

<p>Main igraph repositories now:</p>

<ul>
<li>igraph C library: <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraph">https://github.com/igraph/igraph</a></li>
<li>igraph R package: <a href="https://github.com/igraph/rigraph">https://github.com/igraph/rigraph</a></li>
<li>python-igraph: <a href="https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph">https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph</a></li>
<li>igraphdata R package: <a href="https://github.com/igraph/igraphdata">https://github.com/igraph/igraphdata</a></li>

<p>There are a lot of improvements and corrections in this version. 
We would like to thank all the people who sent comments, bug reports,
patches, or just questions. Without their contribution igraph would be 
definitely much less and worse than it is now. Please keep sending your

<p>The next one in the sequence of bugfix releases. Thanks to many people
sending bug reports. Here are the changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some memory leaks removed when using attributes from R or Python.</li>
<li>GraphML parser: entities and character data in multiple chunks are now handled correctly.</li>
<li>A bug corrected in edge betweenness community structure detection,
it failed if called many times from the same program/session.</li>
<li>Bug corrected in &#39;adjacent edges&#39; edge iterator.</li>
<li>Edge betweeness community structure: handle unconnected graphs properly.</li>
<li>Fixed bug related to fast greedy community detection in unconnected graphs.</li>
<li>Use a different kind of parser (Push) for reading GraphML files. This is almost
invisible for users but fixed a nondeterministic bug when reading in GraphML
files.</li>
<li>R interface: plot now handles properly if called with a vector as the edge.width
argument for directed graphs.</li>
<li>R interface: bug (typo) corrected for walktrap.community and weighted graphs.</li>
<li>Test suite should run correctly on Cygwin now.</li>

<p>I&#39;ve set up two igraph mailing lists: <strong>igraph-help</strong> for
general igraph questions and discussion and
<strong>igraph-anonunce</strong> for announcements. See 
<a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-help">http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-help</a> and
<a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-announce">http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-announce</a>
for subscription information, archives, etc.</p>

<p>Release time at last! There are many new things in igraph 0.2, the
most important ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>reading writing Pajek and GraphML formats with attributes
(not all Pajek and GraphML files are supported, see documentation
for details)</li>
<li>iterators totally rewritten, it is much faster and cleaner now</li>
<li>the RANDEDU fast motif search algorithm is implemented</li>
<li>many new graph generators, both games and regular graphs</li>
<li>many new structural properties: transitivity, reciprocity, etc.</li>
<li>graph operators: union, intersection, difference, structural holes, etc.</li>
<li>conversion between directed and undirected graphs</li>
<li>new layout algorithms for trees and large graphs, 3D layouts</li>
</ul>

<p>and many more.</p>

<p>New things in the R package:</p>

<ul>
<li>support for CTRL+C</li>
<li>new functions: Graph Laplacian, Burt&#39;s constraint, etc.</li>
<li>vertex/edge sequences totally rewritten, smart indexing (see manual)</li>
<li>new R manual and tutorial: &#39;Network Analysis with igraph&#39;, still 
under development but useful</li>
<li>very basic 3D plotting using OpenGL</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this release was somewhat tested on Linux, MS Windows, Mac
OSX, Solaris 8 and FreeBSD, no heavy testing was done, so it might
contain bugs, and we kindly ask you to send bug reports to make igraph
better.</p>
